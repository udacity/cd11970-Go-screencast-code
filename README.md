# Go Screencast Demos

This repo contains code-along content from screencast demos in the Go Nanodegree program.

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

## Setup

Use `go run main.go` to run any of the scripts.

If you encounter missing package issues, run `go get`.

## Contributing

Because this is a code-along project and the commits correspond to specific videos in the program, we will not be accepting pull requests.

If you feel like there's a major problem, please open an issue to discuss the problem and potential resolution.
